- Think about adverserial inputs for greedy algorithm

1. Fixing the path that that minimizes the path -> reduce to an NP complete problem

2. Fixing the number of vertices -> reduce to an NP complete problem

a. Travelling salesman problem -- change the connected graph to a complete graph using some heuristic

+ STEINER TREE (In HW)

b. Set cover (vertex cover)

1. Use randomness
2. Use as many libraries as possible
3. Start early
